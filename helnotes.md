* Some way to inser tgame into engine
* Better scratch pad support i.e easy way to test outr ideas
* Better Textures such as reading, blitting, image processing in Texture class
* seperation between game and engine code
* Add higher level rendering abstractions like a rect or sqare to draw textures instead of having to manage everything by hand like materials, textures, tranform matrices, etc.
* add automatic shader selction
* add primitives for rectangle, sphere, etc
* not having to manage the transform manually (More Flexible transform class) 

BIG LIMITATIONS!!:
* We need Rendering engine and not some bare bones utilities
